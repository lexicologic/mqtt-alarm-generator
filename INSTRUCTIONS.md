## I. MQTT Alarm Aggregator

For this task we would like you design a node.js mqtt client that subscribes and keeps track of six alarm topics.  When **any** of these child topics publishes a value of '0', the client will publish a '0' to the parent topic. Only when  **all** child topics last published a value of '1',  then the client can publish '1' to the parent topic.  The value of '0' represents a flag indicating of that status of that system needing attention, while a value of '1' indicates no attention needed . Assume the initial state of the parent topic is '1'.   

 

The topics are as follows:

```json

"childTopics" : [

  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/inverters/1/status",

  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/inverters/2/status",

  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/inverters/3/status",

  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/inverters/4/status",

  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/inverters/5/status",

  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/inverters/6/status"

]

"parentTopic":  "site/123/photovoltaic/skidControlUnits/01A/status" 

```

Your code will be tested using a local mosquitto broker by publishing '0's and '1's to the child topics.  While subscribing to parent topic to verify the correct status. The broker config (`mosquitto.conf`) will have the following settings:

```

log_type all

listener 1883

allow_anonymous true

```

 

Please use the mqtt.js library and submit as a zip via email or git link. Feel free to add typechecking, unit tests, formatters, linters or any other tooling you think might help or you simply like to use.
